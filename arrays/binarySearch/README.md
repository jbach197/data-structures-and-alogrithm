# Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch that takes in two parameters: a sorted array and a search key.  Return the index of the array element that is equal to the search key.  If the element is not in the array, return -1.  Do not use any built in array methods.

Exmple:

Input                   Output
[2, 3, 6, 7, 9], 7      3
[2, 3, 6, 7, 9], 10     -1
